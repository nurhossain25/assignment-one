                <p>Around 13 lakh people were affected in Sylhet, including five Upazilas.
                    Surma and the Kushiyara rivers started flowing above the danger level.
                    The heavy torrential rainfall in the north-eastern region and India's Meghalaya and Assam has left
                    parts of the district paralysed since May 12. The cyclonic storm Asani worsened the situation.

                <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>At least 49 people have been killed and more than 300 injured after a massive fire swept through BM
                    container depot in Chittagong. More than half of the 100 patients admitted at different hospitals.

                    Families depend on the earnings of all these injured people. So we have a long-term plan to make
                    these people self-reliant, aiming to create employment opportunities.
